This is an alternative web client for the dabi database [here](https://github.com/dshomoye/database-dabi) .

It is ALL in react (and react only). Mainly just a testing water for me to get to my hands dirty with react.
demo here: [demo](http://dabi-react.surge.sh)

Thank God for create-react-app. I would have never bothered with something like this otherwise.
