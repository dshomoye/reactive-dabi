This is an alternative web client for the dabi database [here](https://github.com/dshomoye/database-dabi) .

It is ALL in react (no Redux). Mainly just a testing water for me to get to my hands dirty with react.
demo here: [demo](http://dabi-react.surge.sh)
UI components with MaterialUI and axios for httpRequests.
Thank God for create-react-app, I would have never bothered with something like this otherwise.
